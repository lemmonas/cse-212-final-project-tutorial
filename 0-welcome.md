# Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you about some of the data structures that are available to use in Python. Covered topics are [Stacks](1-stacks.md), [Sets](2-sets.md), and [Trees](3-trees.md). This tutorial will also give the big O notation for each data structure. Big O notation denotes how long the function would take in the worst case scenario.
