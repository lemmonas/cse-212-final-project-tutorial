# Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you about some of the data structures that are available to use in Python. Covered topics are [Stacks](1-stacks.md), [Sets](2-sets.md), and [Trees](3-trees.md). This tutorial will also give the big O notation for each data structure. Big O notation denotes how long the function would take in the worst case scenario. O(1) is the best performance. O(n!) is the worst performance possible, but you won't see it very often. The most common worst performance is O(n^2). Functions are most commonly O(n). Think of O() as a math function similar to f(x), where O() is measuring the amount of time needed to perform a function.
